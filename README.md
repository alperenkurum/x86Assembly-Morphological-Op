# Image Proccesing With x86 Assembly 
This project wrote with inline Assembly for school course named "Entry to Lower Level Programming". Project does dilation and eroion to the grey scale image. I add the instructions (Instruction.pdf) which the school gave me.

### How to use the program

When you start to the program, program wants the image path then asks which morphological operations do you want to use last of all asks the scale of the filter (3 for 3x3 filter, 5 for 5x5 filter). Finally program makes a new  dilation/erosion implemented grey scale image.
